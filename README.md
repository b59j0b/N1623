Bank   Selection   and   Consistency:
Students   are   required to select   a   single   bank   and   competitor   for   in-depth   analysis. This   bank      and   competitor will   be the subject   of   both   the   business   report. This ensures   thematic   coherence   and   allows for   deeper,   more   nuanced   analysis   across   both   components. The total   word   count   is   2000 word   ( +/-10%)   excluding Appendix,   Figures   and Tables.The business   report and video should exhibit a clear   and   logical   connection. Ensure    that      insights   from   the   business   report   inform   and   enrich   the   analysis   presented   in   the   video.   For   example, findings about the selected   bank's overall digital   strategy   in the   report   could   be   used   to   contextualize   the   specific mobile banking features and    embedded   technology solutions   discussed.
The   availability   of financial   data for   last five years   (balance sheet,   income statements,   annual reports) from   Bloomberg   Database. The   document   must   be written   in   Harvard Style.
Competitor   Selection:Once you've   chosen your   primary   bank, select   a suitable competitor   for   comparison.   Ensure   the   competitor   offers   comparable   mobile   banking services and   integrates AI   in similar   ways.   Consider:
-             Banks   of   similar   size   and   market   segment   (RV   function,   or   Fame/Orbis   peer   analysis   or Statista)
-             Banks   recognized   for   AI   solutions   for   banking   operations/   products   (Bloomberg   Terminal -Function   CN,   DES,   DS)
-             Banks   operating   in the   same   geographical   region   (Bloomberg   Terminal   -Function   RV,   DES)
Data   Sources
To   be   able to   process this   report, student   need to   use   Bloomberg   Databases   or Annual   Report
Other valuable sources of   information:

Time   management
The   earlier you start the   project, the   better. The   lectures   and seminars   are   designed to   help   you work   on your   project. The   best   approach would   be to   meet   up weekly   and   apply   the   knowledge gained from the classes to   advance your   assignment. For   each   seminar,   you   will   have the   opportunity to   ask   questions   regarding your   project   during the   last   10   minutes   at the   end   of the workshop. This skill   is   related to   how to   create   a   project   schedule. The   only   way to   achieve the   project’s goals within the given   timeframe   that   has   been   decided   on   is   to   breakdown the goals   into tasks   on   a timeline. You   are   required to set   up   a   realistic   schedule   and then   manage the   resources   needed to   keep   on track so that the   project   can   be   successfully   concluded   on time. You   might   use   an   online   Gantt   Chart.
Risk   management
Any   project   is   inherent with   risk.   It   is   essential to   become familiar with these   issues   before   they   become   problems.   Different   problems can   arise, such   as   other   assignments,   lack   of access to the   database, the   crash   of computer systems   etc...   It   is   essential to   keep   track   of   different   documents   and other vital   issuesAttend   Lectures   and   Seminars:   These   sessions   will   provide   crucial   details   about   each task   and the expected outcomes. Active participation   is essential to ensure a comprehensive   understanding   of the   material.   Please   do   not   hesitate to   ask   clarifying   questions   during these   sessions.
